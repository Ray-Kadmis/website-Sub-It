                            engine problems, brake malfunctions, and electrical issues, and repair and replace parts
                            once the problem is identified. This job requires you to be quite vigilant.</p>
                        <h2>Essential Responsibilities</h2>
                        <p>Every vehicle mechanic has many responsibilities. These responsibilities must be fulfilled
                            dutifully so that the vehicles function correctly. Below are some of the essential duties of
                            air vehicle mechanics.</p>
                        <ul>

                                confused by using the technical manuals. It includes dismantling and reassembling
                                lifting devices and hand and pneumatic tools.</li>
                            <li>You will be asked to perform inspection and repairs and replace components, engines,
                                transmissions, and sub-assemblies.</li>
                            <li>One of your core responsibilities is training team members to solve unusual maintenance
                                problems. You will teach them how to recognise and troubleshoot various issues. You will
                                also have to identify parts in repair manuals and request an order for those parts if
                                needed.</li>
                            <li>You will also have to direct workers in cleaning parts and assembling various equipment.
                                You may have to adjust and maintain machinery such as stripping and loading shovels.
                                This machinery will also include drilling and cutting machines and related equipment.
                            </li>
                            <li>You will also recommend revisions to maintenance procedures to improve efficiency. You
                                will also have to ensure quality artistry.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <img src="" alt="">
                        <h2>Work environment and physical demands</h2>
                        <p>The work you will perform will be in a shop, and the environment will be moderately light. It
                            is sometimes heated and ventilated, exposing you to disagreeable fumes. You may also have
                            face cuts and bruises from using tools in closed spaces.</p>

                        <p>You will also face the hazards of moving vehicles such as forklifts and sweepers in the shop
                            area. Keep in mind that while performing the duties of this job, you will be regularly
                            required to stand and use your hands. You will also use your fingers to handle or feel
                            various equipment. You will frequently need to walk and reach with your hands and arms.</p>

                        <p>You will also be required to stoop, kneel, crouch, and even crawl. You will have to work in
                            tiring and uncomfortable positions, so this is a physically demanding field. You will
                            occasionally be required to sit, climb, or balance as an employee. Your job may even require
                            you to taste or smell to ensure everything is functioning correctly with the vehicle.</p>

                        <p>You will frequently lift items weighing at least 40 to 45 lbs, which can even increase to
                            more than 50 lbs. You will be exposed to moving mechanical parts, extreme heat, and
                            vibration. The employees will occasionally be exposed to wet and humid conditions because
                            they might have to work in highly precarious places. They will work in fumes or airborne
                            particles, outside weather conditions, and extreme cold.</p>

                        <p>There is also the risk of electrical shocks, so keep that in mind. The noise level in your
                            work environment will usually be loud, and you may be working in unsafe conditions. You will
                            also question nonstandard operations over environmental factors involving unmitigated
                            hazards. You will provide your feedback to the supervisors and managers on all safety issues
                            to ensure improvement in the workspace. You will also perform preventive maintenance checks
                            and services on equipment and report any faults if you find any. You must be able to speak,
                            read, correct and understand English.</p>

                                            time-consuming. This is frustrating for employers and employees. Often,
                                            people go out of their way to contact recruitment agencies and still waste
                                            much of their time.</p>
